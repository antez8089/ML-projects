# Machine Learning Algorithms in Python

## About
This repository is a deep dive into the foundations of machine learning, where I implemented various algorithms entirely from scratch using Python. It’s a journey through optimization, neural networks, classification, evolutionary techniques, and reinforcement learning, aimed at understanding the "how" behind the tools we often take for granted.

## What I Implemented
- **Optimization Algorithms**:
  - Steepest Descent, and Hessian variations.
- **Neural Networks**:
  - Feedforward networks, backpropagation, and activation functions.
- **Classification Methods**:
  - Decision Treess.
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**:
  - Genetic Algorithms for solving complex optimization problems.
- **Reinforcement Learning**:
  - Q-learning.

## What I Learned
- **Fundamentals of Optimization**:
  - Building optimization algorithms from the ground up gave me an intuitive understanding of gradients, loss functions, and convergence challenges.
- **The Core of Neural Networks**:
  - I demystified backpropagation and understood the math behind neural networks without relying on frameworks.
- **Data Preprocessing and Manipulation**:
  - Working with pandas taught me efficient ways to clean and structure data for machine learning tasks.
- **Adaptation and Exploration**:
  - Evolutionary algorithms pushed me to think creatively about non-standard optimization problems.
- **Learning by Trial and Error**:
  - Reinforcement learning reinforced (pun intended) the value of exploration versus exploitation in dynamic environments.

## Why It Matters
This repository isn't just about code—it's about building intuition for machine learning concepts and bridging the gap between theory and application. By implementing these algorithms myself, I gained a clearer, hands-on understanding of the math and logic driving modern machine learning.
